      <description>While the automotive industry starts to realize the mistakes of the past, penetration testers, researchers and automakers strive to create impenetrable vehicle components, with the ultimate purpose being safer streets inside and outside of our vehicles. However, as desirable as this can be, it had an impact in other aspects of the automotive landscape, notably in terms of privacy and ownership, out of many.
Tuners and car enthusiasts, while they might have no direct connection to cyber security, they have significantly contributed to vehicle vulnerabilities and exploitation over the years.</description>

      <description>Title: How I Hacked My Way to the Security Sector {And why you should always do what you love, no matter what people say!}
Abstract:
It all started 30 years ago… hm, that’s a bit too much, let me try again.
It all started 18 years ago, when I found a book of C in my uncles’ library. How stupid can you be to read C at 12 years old you might ask?</description>

      <description>This research is dedicated to enhancing the cybersecurity of electric vehicles, with a specific focus on identifying vulnerabilities in the Electric Vehicle Communication Controller (EVCC). This controller facilitates communication with the Supply Equipment Communication Controller during the charging process. Accessible through the On-Board Charging (OBC) port, which is as publicly available as the gas tank in combustion engine vehicles.
The research journey began by studying the electric vehicle charging ports, how they communicate, and the standards they follow, especially focusing on ISO 15118.</description>

      <description>While hardware security is a topic of interest for decades, devices are constantly getting smaller, more powerful and more complicated. Most would assume that this resulted in higher security standards, but from our 100+ penetration tests in the (heavily hardware based) automotive industry, we beg to differ.
With automotive suppliers trying to make everything work under heavily constrained environments, with limited resources both for energy and processing power, understandably many things are getting left out of the table, with one of the biggest victim being security.</description>

      <description>In this talk, we will revisit some of the scariest stories we faced during more than 50 penetration testing and security research projects, with a twist. In the ever-emerging industry of automotive, with old and new OEMs trying to get a share of the pie, many things are at stake, with many things getting overlooked, forgotten, or even deliberately covered. We will go through a journey of critical findings in different targets and the constant battle between penetration testers, developers, and mid to upper management.</description>

      <description>The automotive industry presented significant advances in the sector in the last decade, to catch up with the technological advances of the world. Lack of proper regulations and security standards meant that automotive companies had to develop custom solutions most of the time, which resulted in a lot of security issues. Security testing also fell behind, as there was no significant need till now to test and research those devices, but with more and more connected components the risks are increasing rapidly.</description>

      <description>A fuzzing module for the UDS protocol, as a CaringCaribou contribution. It includes the following sub-functions:
seed_randomness_fuzzer: Supply the seed request process used by the target ECU and fuzz it to test for possible duplicates after a supplied Hard ECUReset (with flexibility on the reset method implementation), which means that the device is possibly vulnerable.
delay_fuzzer: This is more of an exploitation sub-function, where a seed request process is supplied, alongside the seed from a single seed/key pair that a tester has acquired.</description>

CVE-ID: CVE-2021-29507
Author: Thomas Sermpinis
Versions: 2.10.0 &amp;lt; version &amp;lt;= 2.18.6
Package URL: https://github.com/GENIVI/dlt-daemon/
Tested on: dlt-daemon 2.18.6

      <description>Title: Stack based buffer overflow while parsing JSON file in Aleth C++ Ethereum client
Date: 11/01/2021
CVE-ID: CVE-2020-26800
Author: Thomas Sermpinis
Versions: &amp;lt;= 1.8.0
Package URL: https://github.com/ethereum/aleth
Tested on: Aleth C++ Ethereum Client 1.8.0
An attacker can supply a specially crafted config.json file, consisting of 3764 left square brackets or more, which results in segmentation fault by the application. This immediately results in Denial of Service, and with more advanced exploitation it can have further implications, with higher severity security issues.</description>

      <description>Title: File Type Restriction Bypass in Socket.io-file NPM module
Date: 31/07/2020
CVE-ID: CVE-2020-24807
Author: Thomas Sermpinis
Versions: &amp;lt;= 2.0.31
Package URL: -
Tested on: node v10.19.0, Socket.io-file v2.0.31, socket.io v2.3.0
All versions of socket.io-file are vulnerable to a file restriction bypass. The validation for valid file types only happens on the client-side, which allows an attacker to intercept the Websocket request post-validation and alter the name value to upload any file types.</description>

      <description>OSCEs have expert-level penetration testing skills. They have proven that they can craft their own exploits, execute attacks to compromise systems, and gain administrative access. The intense 48-hour exam also demonstrates that OSCEs have an above-average degree of persistence, determination, and ability to perform under pressure and can think outside the box to determine innovative ways of penetrating internal networks. An OSCE also has familiarity with more advanced protections like ASLR.</description>

Tested on: node v10.19.0, Socket.io-file v2.0.31, socket.io v2.3.0
All versions of socket.io-file are vulnerable to Path Traversal. The package fails to sanitize user input and uses it to generate the file upload paths. The socket.io-file::createFile message contains a name option that is passed directly to path.join(). It is possible to upload files to arbitrary folders on the server by sending relative paths on the name value, such as .</description>

      <description>Mi Notebook Pro by Xiaomi is a 15inch laptop which was widely adopted because of its good price/performance ratio. This made it a huge success and created a big community of hackers wanting to fix some minor issues that the laptop had, alongside adding new capabilities, like natevelly running MacOS.
I created a repo including all the available mods, and additional stuff I created for this device.

      <description>My masters thesis, supervised by Athena Vakali, was based on blockchain technologies with the title “PKI Decentralization Using Blockchain Technologies”.
Abstract The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is used widely on the Internet in order to certify the identity of users, and as a result encrypt the communication between two parties and make it more secure. From this model, multiple problems can arise, most of them due to its centralized nature. In the past, there have been cases of Certificate Authorities distributing rogue certificates that resulted in attacks, targeting users of the system.</description>

Abstract (Greek) Στην παρούσα εργασία θα αναφερθούμε και θα εξετάσουμε μία καινοτόμο εφαρμογή που έχει να κάνει με την εφαρμογή της τεχνολογίας NFC, και παράλληλα της πολιτικής BYOD, στα συστήματα WMS. Τα κύρια σημεία που εξετάστηκαν είναι το αν υπάρχει ενδιαφέρον από τους εργαζομένους, όσο αναφορά την εφαρμογή ενός τέτοιου συστήματος στον χώρο εργασίας τους, και αν είναι δυνατή η ανάπτυξη ενός ολοκληρωμένου συστήματος με την προσθήκη των τεχνολογιών και πολιτικών που προτείνονται.</description>
