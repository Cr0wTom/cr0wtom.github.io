      <description>2600 is one of the oldest and most appreciated by me magazines in the security community. It is a joy to read, with interesting stories from hackers from all over the world. Writing to this legend was a must for me, so I composed a really interesting story, describing how privacy concern can drive you crazy, how it can lead you to losing everything and a debate on what can anc cannot be the attitute of online entities in our modern world.</description>

      <description>Mi Notebook Pro by Xiaomi is a 15inch laptop which was widely adopted because of its good price/performance ratio. This made it a huge success and created a big community of hackers wanting to fix some minor issues that the laptop had, alongside adding new capabilities, like natevelly running MacOS.
I created a repo including all the available mods, and additional stuff I created for this device.

      <guid>https://cr0wtom.github.io/projects/pki-decentralization-using-blockchain-technologies/</guid>
      <description>My masters thesis, supervised by Athena Vakali, was based on blockchain technologies with the title “PKI Decentralization Using Blockchain Technologies”.
Abstract The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is used widely on the Internet in order to certify the identity of users, and as a result encrypt the communication between two parties and make it more secure. From this model, multiple problems can arise, most of them due to its centralized nature. In the past, there have been cases of Certificate Authorities distributing rogue certificates that resulted in attacks, targeting users of the system.</description>

Abstract (Greek) Στην παρούσα εργασία θα αναφερθούμε και θα εξετάσουμε μία καινοτόμο εφαρμογή που έχει να κάνει με την εφαρμογή της τεχνολογίας NFC, και παράλληλα της πολιτικής BYOD, στα συστήματα WMS. Τα κύρια σημεία που εξετάστηκαν είναι το αν υπάρχει ενδιαφέρον από τους εργαζομένους, όσο αναφορά την εφαρμογή ενός τέτοιου συστήματος στον χώρο εργασίας τους, και αν είναι δυνατή η ανάπτυξη ενός ολοκληρωμένου συστήματος με την προσθήκη των τεχνολογιών και πολιτικών που προτείνονται.</description>

      <description>For a couple of years I was constalty cooperating with DeltaHacker as a Magazine Editor for penetration testing and cyber security technical topics, with my nickname being Cr0wTom. I wrote 10 articles in total, but suddenly they exist only in Greek and you can find abstracts of the article in my blog, but you can also purchace all of DeltaHacker&amp;rsquo;s issues by their website.
DeltaHacker alongside my personal blog, can be considered my start in the security industry, my first steps and some really exciting times with people from the Greek hacking community that I really apreciate.</description>
